Search configuration complete.

MESSAGE: no valid mappings found within search criteria. Some suggestions:
(1) Observe each mapper thread's termination message. If it terminated due to
    consecutive failed mappings, it will tell you the number of mappings that
    failed because of a spatial fanout violation and the number that failed
    because of a buffer capacity violation.
(2) Check your architecture configuration (especially mapspace constraints).
    Try to find the offending constraints that are likely to have caused the
    above violations, and disable those constraints.
(3) Try other search algorithms, and relax the termination criteria:
    victory-condition, timeout and/or search-size.
(4) Enable mapper's diagnostics (mapper.diagnostics = True) to track and emit 
    more information about failed mappings.
